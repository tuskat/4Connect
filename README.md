# FourConnect

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

This is a basic 4Connect game. Endgoal of the project is to have both match against a computer, and against a 2nd player.

## Challenge

The biggest challenge was to admit I am not good with AI algorithm, and inspired myself with a different project. It wasn't ticking and going as smoothly as the rest of the project.

## Process

- Apart from automatically generated code by Angular CLI, all the code has been written by me.
- [Animate.css] (https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) has been included for the animations.
- It must be noted that the AI (BotService) code was heavily inspired by this [Project] (https://github.com/Gimu/connect-four-js)

## Technologies Used

- Angular 2 via Angular CLI
- HTML5/CSS3
- NodeJs
- Animate.css

## Technology choices

Angular 2 was chosen because I wanted a separation between the logic of the game, placed in the services, and the interface. The project is quite lightweight, and do not use any assets : everything you see was done via CSS and use one font. It is also responsive, and should adapt to any screen devices.

## Testing the app

- install nodeJs
- extract/clone project on your computer 
- go to root folder of the project
- npm install
- npm start
